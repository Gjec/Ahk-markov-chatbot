# Ahk-markov-chatbot
Ahk markov chatbot I made for fun

add quotes, or random sentences from someone into the "ChatData" folder (make sure seperate sentences are each put on their own line), then start the script. Press "7" on the numpad to put another word (I'll probably make it make full sentences atuomatically at some point).

The notification box popping up just lets you know that you've reached the end of the generated sentence.

if you dont like a generated sentence, just delete what it wrote, and press enter to reset it.
