# Ahk-markov-chatbot
Ahk markov chatbot I made for fun

add quotes, or random sentences from someone into the "ChatData" folder (make sure seperate sentences are each put on their own line), then start the script. Press "7" on the numpad to make sentence.

if you dont like a generated sentence, just delete what it wrote.
